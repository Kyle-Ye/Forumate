## The Project Inspiration

In 2021, considering the unsatisfactory experience of Swift Forums on iPhone, I posted a  [topic](https://forums.swift.org/t/swift-forum-client/53484) asking for a Swift Forum's client recommendation.

Someone recommended Fig to me. It was a great client and after I installed it I thought I shouldn't reinvent the wheel to build a same app and gave up the idea of making a new client.

Unfortunately, Fig has not been updated for many years and even has been removed from the App Store. So I build Forumate from scratch in my spare time with SwiftUI and share the code under a custom license.
